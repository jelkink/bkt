Web-based bookkeeping software.

Based on double-entry bookkeeping. Fully configurable in terms of accounts and transactions. Ability to add notes and tags.

Main feature is that there is a text-based script to summarise all transactions, which can be used for import and export to the database. The full books can be exported to human-readable text format, edited, and re-imported.
